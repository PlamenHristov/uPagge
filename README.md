## üê∂ My pet-projects

### [Godfather Bots](https://github.com/Godfather-Bots)
A set of projects that allow you to quickly create bots for VKontakte or Telegram. Also based on abstract projects, you can add a project to any other social network with the ability to create bots. I have been writing this project for as long as I can remember, or rather it is an extension of my diploma work :).

### [Haiti Framework](https://github.com/haiti-projects)
None of us like to write boiler code, it's a set of projects that allow us to develop faster, so we have time to lie on the beach.
